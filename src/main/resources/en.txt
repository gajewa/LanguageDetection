The half-length portrait shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456)[10] in a three-quarter

the apex of Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands

clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the
work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's
later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of
Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.[11]
Maria's face is idealised and conforms to contemporary ideals of beauty, especially in the raised eyebrows and
elongated nose.[12] The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's
panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon.[12] In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared
to her head, a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by Rogier van
der Weyden and Petrus Christus.[13] Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted
stone frame, acting as a trompe-l'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer.[14]

The black hennin is long, truncated and relatively plain[16] with a transparent veil which falls around the back of her neck,
resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the necklace. Her costume
is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong
nose, full lips and a pointed chin.[17] Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like
a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved

Maria's necklace is gilded and studded with pearls, rubies and sapphires. It contains three open flowers; one white with
a ruby jewel, another red with a sapphire, and one gray-blue with a pearl. The upper line contains a row of onyx beads,
from which hang, according to the art historian Sophie McConnell "small teardrops" gold and bluish-grey enameled wire.[16]
The necklace is very similar to that worn by Margaret of York at her wedding to Charles the Bold in 1468, an occasion the
Portinaris attended.[19][20] A depiction of Charles in a double Portrait with Isabella of Bourbon, now in Ghent, closely
resembles that of Thomas in facial features, while Isabella and Maria look very similar.[21] Dirk De Vos believes van der
Goes may have seen Memling's panel when he stayed with Tommaso in Bruges c. 1497, and incorporated elements for his own depiction.[14]
The panel is in very good condition and among the best preserved of Memling's work.[20] Technical examination using
x-radiography shows that the hennin originally contained pearls which formed the letters "T" and "M", standing for
Tommaso and Maria. Similar pearl monograms, which would have been intended as a sign of marital connection, can be
found in van der Goes's portraits of the couple.[22] Maryan Ainsworth concludes that they were removed from the final
composition as they may have been "deemed too conspicuous a show of opulence in the presence of the Virgin and Child,
most likely the now lost object of Maria's veneration."[23] Maria's ear was at one stage exposed, but was later covered
by the wide frontlet of the hennin, a change of mind also found in the very similar portrait of the female donor in
Memling's c. 1470s to early 1480 Donne Triptych.[24]

The panel has at various times been attributed to van der Goes and van Eyck, but was recognized
as by Memling as early as the time of the seminal 1902 exhibition Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges in Bruges,
when it was lent by Léopold Goldschmidt of Paris. In 1916 Max J. Friedländer described it as "without doubt" by Memling, and c.
1475.[25] The art historian Catheline Périer-d'Ieteren, while noting that Memling's portrait faces were rarely underdrawn,
wrote that this panel contains "thin yet confident incised lines" which may be preliminary drawings for Maria's face, perhaps made from life.[26]

The triptych was recorded in an inventory of Tommaso's holdings upon his death. The New York panels passed
through Tommaso's son Francesco. The central panel was described in his 1544 will as "a small tabernacle with three
movable wings, in which is depicted the glorious Virgin Mary and the father and mother of the donor" Francesco bequeathed the triptych to the
convent of the hospital of Saint Maria Nuova in Florence. Records indicate a small intact winged altarpiece which stayed in the
hospital's possession until around the time of the Napoleonic occupation, when it was probably broken up.[4]
Maria's panel was sold as a Dieric Bouts for Fr6,000 in 1870. It later passed through several private collections
before arriving in the possession of Elia Volpi of Rome, who briefly returned it to Florence. Thereafter the panels were in
London from 1901, from where they were sold to Villeroy Goldschmidt of Paris by for $426,500 in 1910.[9] They were purchased,
also in 1910, by the collector Benjamin Altman of New York on the advice of Friedländer, along with works by Albrecht Dürer, Gerard
David and Hans Holbein the Younger – paintings whose "grave austerity seems to have been most in tune with his own taste".[27] Altman
bequeathed his holdings to the Metropolitan on his death in 1913.[28][29]
